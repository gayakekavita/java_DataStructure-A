.java file -----> compiler compiles it ---->.class file ----> interpreter ----> Machine code (0 and 1).

--we write code in  human readable format using .java extension .
-- then compiler takes whole file and compiles it and convert it into .class file (Byte code ) .
-- then interpreter interpretes byte code line by line and convert it into machine code (0 and 1) .
-- To run byte code we need java virtual Machine(JVM).

--why java is platform independant?
  * Byte code can run on all operating systems.
  * we  need to convert source code into machine code so computer can understand it .
  * compiler helps in doing this by turing it into exucutable code .
  * this executable code is set of instructions for the computer.
  * after compiling c/c++ file we get .exe file which is platform dependant.
  * In java we get byte code , JVM converrts it into machine code .
  * so it can run on any platform .
  * Java is platform independant but JVM is platform dependant.

--why jvm is platform dependant?
  * because for every different os there is different JVM.
  * if we are using windows then we downlod the JVM of windows .
  * if we are using linux then we download the JVm of linux os.

-- architecure of java
   1. JDK (Java Devlopment Kit)=  JRE + Devlopment tools
   2. JRE (Java runtime environment )= JVM + Liabrary classes 
   3. JVM (Java virtual machine)
   4.JIT (Just in time ).

  1.JDK :
  - It is a package which includes ::
      # devlopment tools : which provide an environment to devlope your program.
      # JRE : to execute your program
      # a compiler : javac 
      # archiver : jar
      # docs generater : javadocs 
      # interpreter / loader
  - It provides envrionment to devlop and run java programs.


  2. JRE :
  -stands for "Java Runtime Environment".
  - It is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program.
  - It consist of :
       # Deployment technologies 
       # user interface toolkits 
       # Integration liabraries
       # base liabraries 
       # JVM
  - After we get the .class file , the next things happen at runtime :
       # class loader loads all the classes needed to execute the program.
       # JVM sends code to Byte code verifier to check the format of the code .
  - we cannot create java programs using JRE .
  - we can only run java programs.


---------Compile time ----------
 .java file ----> is taken by javac compiler---> converted into ------------>.class file 



-----------RunTime-----------------
