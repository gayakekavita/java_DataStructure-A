.java file -----> compiler compiles it ---->.class file ----> interpreter ----> Machine code (0 and 1).

--we write code in  human readable format using .java extension .
-- then compiler takes whole file and compiles it and convert it into .class file (Byte code ) .
-- then interpreter interpretes byte code line by line and convert it into machine code (0 and 1) .


--why java is platform independant?
  * Byte code can run on all operating systems.
  * we  need to convert source code into machine code so computer can understand it .
  * compiler helps in doing this by turing it into exucutable code .
  * this executable code is set of instructions for the computer.
  * after compiling c/c++ file we get .exe file which is platform dependant.
  * In java we get byte code , JVM converrts it into machine code .
  * so it can run on any platform .
  * Java is platform independant but JVM is platform dependant.

--why jvm is platform dependant?
  * because for every different os there is different JVM.
  * if we are using windows then we downlod the JVM of windows .
  * if we are using linux then we download the JVm of linux os.

-- architecure of java
   1. JDK (Java Devlopment Kit)=  JRE + Devlopment tools
   2. JRE (Java runtime environment )= JVM + Liabrary classes 
   3. JVM (Java virtual machine)
   4.
