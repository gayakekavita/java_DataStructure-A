--array is collection of the elements of the same data  type.
--declaration syntax 
   datatype[] array_var_name= new datatype[size];
   ex:  1. int[] roll=new int[5];
        2. int[] roll={12,34,443,3,2};
        -- int[] roll : declaration of roll array 
                      : here roll is getting defined in the stack 
                      : this happen at compile time
        -- roll=new int[] 
                      :here actual object is created in heap memory .
                      : this thing is happend at runtime , is called  as dynamic memory allocation.
        -- in the example "roll" is a reference variable present in stack memory which ponts to the object {12,34,443,3,2} object present in heap memory.
** because of following reason array are  not continuos in java ***
-- all the object are in heap.
-- heap objects are not continous.
-- heap memory is runtime area memory.
-- dynmaic memory allocation.
-- allocation is totally depend on jvm.
-- "new" is a keyword is used to create objects in heap memory .
-- in the example :
      int[] roll={12,34,443,3,2}; 
       * here we wre not putting "new" but  "{12,34,443,3,2};" do internal work of creatiog object in heap memory .
-- for "integer" array if we do not intialize anything then by
