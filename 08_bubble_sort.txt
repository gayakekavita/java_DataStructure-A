--Bubble sort is one of the sorting algorithm.
-- here iterations are called as pass .
--  at first pass largest element is placed at last position of array.
-- at second pass second largest element is placed at second last position of the array.
--it is also known as sinking sort .
--also known as exchange sort.
-- space complexity is : O(1)
    it means we do not require any extra space to sort the array.
-- it is also known as "inplace" algorithm.
-- Time complexity :
     Best Case: O(n)
     Worst case:O(n2) [when array is in descending order]
    n= no of comparision 

-- as the size of array is growing the number of comparision is also growing in the worst case .

--  if the array is already sorted to track this thing inside the inner  loop  when swapping is happened thenn we make swapped variable as "true".
-- at the end of inner for loop then we will give a check 
    if(!swapped){
       break;
    }
   because if the array is already sorted then it is not going to run further for loop.
